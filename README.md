Quick Settings Audio Panel (QSAP) is a gnome 45/46/47/48 extension that creates a new panel for sound related stuff in the quick settings.

--------

Note: not all features are displayed here.

Notice
------

The Bluetooth menu overflows the other quick settings below it. It's a known issue that is not related to this extension, and I can't fix it.

Compatibility
-------------

As it's heavily inspired by it, this plugin is mostly incompatible with Quick Settings Tweaker (QST). However, as long as you don't enable features that try to do the same thing, it should work.

Known incompatibilities are:
  - Everything in the `Input/Output` tab of QST won't work if you enable `Move master volume sliders`. However, no crash should be observed.
  - The notification panel added by QST can't be separated from the quick settings menu.
  - `Remove Media Control on Date Menu` (but not `Remove Notifications On Date Menu`) will remove the media controls from the sound panel if you **move** the media controls using this extension. If you **duplicate** the media controls with the extension, they won't be affected.
  - In some situations, disabling QSAP can crash QST.

Older versions
--------------

Versions for Gnome 43 and 44 are still available, but no new features or bug fixes will be made for these versions.

Manual installation
-------------------

If you can't install the extension from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org) for some reason, you can install it manually. This extension **CANNOT** be installed on gnome-shell 42 or older.

Instructions:
 * Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Rayzeq/quick-settings-audio-panel/releases)
 * Extract the zip archive you just downloaded in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`
 * Rename the extracted folder to `quick-settings-audio-panel@rayzeq.github.io`
 * The two preceding instructions can also be done with this command: `gnome-extensions install path/to/
quick-settings-audio-panel@rayzeq.github.io.shell-extension.zip --force`
 * Restart gnome shell (the easiest way is to log out and log back in)
